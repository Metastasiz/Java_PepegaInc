Apologies to Professor Slawomir Danczak
Since this project is roughly done and I'm quite embarrassed and I did not have enough time to properly finish it according to my standards - I took too many OTs :(

Project is made in roughly 4 days, enjoy :)

INCREASE resolution of the map in MapGen.mul
Seed of the map can be changed in MapGen line 14-15
    //MapGen map = new MapGen("hex seed here");
Map generation is not randomised by procedure generation by the seed
